# Website

A simple static website created by Mishail01.

This repository contains the source files for a lightweight static site — perfect as a personal site, portfolio, or project landing page.

## Repository contents

- `index.html` — main page
- `main.js` — site JavaScript
- `style.css` — site styles
- `images/` — image assets used by the site
- `README.md` — this file
- `LICENSE` — repository license (MIT)

(If your files are in a subfolder, update the paths above accordingly.)

## Features

- Pure static HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- Responsive layout
- Fast and easy to customize
- No build tools or frameworks required

## Tech stack

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox / Grid)
- Vanilla JavaScript

## Getting started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Mishail01/Website.git
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser:
   - Double-click the file, or
   - Serve it with a local static server (recommended if main.js fetches resources).

Quick local server options:
- Python 3:
  ```
  python -m http.server 8000
  then open http://localhost:8000
  ```
- Node (http-server):
  ```
  npx http-server
  ```

## Development / Customization

- Update content in `index.html`.
- Edit or add styles in `style.css`.
- Modify or add interactivity in `main.js`.
- Put images in the `images/` folder and reference them from the HTML/CSS/JS.
- Add more pages and link them from the navigation.

Tips:
- Keep CSS modular and semantic HTML for accessibility.
- Optimize images in `images/` to reduce page load time.
